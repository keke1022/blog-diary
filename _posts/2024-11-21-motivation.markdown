I decided to start this diary on November 19th, 2024. 

**I realized I was lost**. For over twenty years, I have never truly considered the ultimate purpose of my life. Drifting along the mainstream for the past decade, I now feel directionless as graduation approaches.

I found myself **losing focus, neglecting self-reflection, and, most importantly, forgetting how to live for myself**. In recent years, I  lived largely for others -- meeting their expectations, being caring, thoughtful, and accommodating. While these are admirable traits, they should not be defined as the purpose for one's life. As your loved one leaves, you will be left at the crossroad of life, forced to confront what truly matters. 

Another reason for this diary is my struggle to express myself in foreign languages. Writing in English is my opportunity to refine my words, improve clarity, and articulate my thoughts.
