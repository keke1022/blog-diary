This is my first attempt to document my introspections. I have been reflecting on similar topics late in the night, often disrupting my sleep, yet unable to recall my thoughts the next day. When I was chatting with one of my friend this morning, he mentioned that people change without being noticed. This argument is a compelling starting point.

### Personal Experiences of Change

First, I will write down my experiences. I changed in my middle school, high school, and in university with different reasons. 
1. In my middle school, I was frustrated by my slow progress in math, so I transformed from complacency to modesty. 
2. In my high school, I realized that effort outweights talent, which motivates me to work diligently.
3. In university, I believed that study is never on the top of my life. I became more caring and thoughtful (at least trying to be more thoughtful).

### Reflections on Change

1. These changes are far from trivial, because they **collectively shape the person** I am today.
2. Most of these shifts are triggered from setbacks with **irreversible results**.

I have come to believe that people's mind evolves on changes as a survival mechanism in challenging environments, a form of **self-protection**.

### Deeper Questions

Why do people change affections, like Love?

My own experiences are **passive**, meaning they are driven by external factors. **Active, intentional changes**, however, are rooted in their **core personal values (核心价值观)**. People actively choose a path that is align with their **best personal fulfillment**.

**I conclude that people change dur to the interplay of the environment, passion, and time. They change because they want to protect themselves in changing or harsh environment, or make self-achievements like personal growth or satisfactions.**

The environment, in particular, shapes people by creating new memories and emotional responses. These experiences redefine how individuals perceive themselves, ultimately influencing their behaviors and decisions.
